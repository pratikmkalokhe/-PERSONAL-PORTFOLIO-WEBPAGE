##This project involves designing a basic single page portfolio website using only HTML and CSS to effectively showcase a developer's projects, skills, and contact information. The primary goal is to create a clean, visually appealing, and responsive layout that works well across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
The website is structured into key sections including:
Hero section with the developerâ€™s name, title, and a short introduction
Projects section displaying featured projects with images, descriptions, and links
Skills section highlighting technical proficiencies
About section to share background, experience, or goals
Contact section with social links or a simple contact form
The navigation bar at the top allows users to smoothly scroll to each section, providing a seamless browsing experience. CSS media queries are used to make the layout adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability on mobile devices.
Styling focuses on modern design principles such as consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes without relying on any JavaScript. Hover effects and smooth transitions enhance user interactivity, giving the site a professional polish.
This portfolio is a great starter project for beginner developers, helping them demonstrate their front-end skills while providing a foundation to build upon with additional features like animations, project filtering, or JavaScript powered interactivity in the future.
